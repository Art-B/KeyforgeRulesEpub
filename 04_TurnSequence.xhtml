		<h1>Turn Sequence</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The game is played over a series of turns. Players alternate taking turns until one player wins the game.
			</p>

			<p>Each turn consists of five steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Forge a key.</li>
				<li>Choose a house.</li>
				<li>Play, discard, and use cards of the chosen house.</li>
				<li>Ready cards.</li>
				<li>Draw cards.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The player taking a turn is referred to as the active player. The active player is the only player that can perform actions or make decisions; a player does not make any decisions when it is not their turn.
			</p>

			<p>Each step is described in the following sections.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Step 1: Forge a Key</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				If the active player has enough Æmber to forge a key during this step, they must do so. To forge a key, the active player spends Æmber from the Æmber pool on their identity card, returning it to the common supply. Then, that player flips any one of their key tokens over to its forged side, indicating that the key has been forged.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>The default cost to forge a key is <em>six</em> Æmber.</strong> Some card abilities
					may increase or decrease this number.
				</li>
				<li>
					No more than one key can be forged during this step each turn, even if the active player has enough Æmber to forge multiple keys.
				</li>
				<li>
					Some cards have effects that allow Æmber on these cards to be spent when forging keys. If there is enough Æmber on cards with this effect you control combined with the Æmber in your Æmber pool to forge a key you must do so during Step 1.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h2>Step 2: Choose a House</h2>
		<div>
			<!-- TODO Insert gallery of house logos -->
			<p>
				Each KeyForge deck is composed of three different houses, which are shown on the identity card. During this step, the active player chooses one of the houses on their identity card to activate, making it the <strong>active house</strong> for the remainder of the turn. This active house determines which cards the active player can play, discard from their hand, and use this turn.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>After choosing a house, the active player has the option to take all cards in their archives and add them to their hand. (See “Archives” in the Glossary.)<!-- TODO link -->
				</li>
				<li>
					If a player controls a card that does not belong to one of the three houses on their identity card, they may (if they desire) choose and activate that house during this step instead of one of the three houses in their deck.
				</li>
				<li>
					A player cannot choose to activate a house unless it is either on their identity card or they control a card that belongs to that house. If a card effect instructs a player that they must activate a house other than one in the aforementioned categories, that card effect is ignored (See Cannot VS Must/May.)<!-- TODO link -->
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h2>Step 3: Play, Discard, and Use Cards of the Chosen House</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The active player may play or discard any number of cards of the active house from their hand and may use any number of cards of the active house that are in play under their control. Eligible cards may be played, used, or discarded in any order.
			</p>

			<p>
				A card’s house is determined by an icon in the upper-left corner. If the active house corresponds
				to a card’s icon, that card is eligible to be played, used, or discarded.
			</p>

			<p>Rules for playing, discarding, and using cards are described later. <!-- TODO link --></p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>First Turn Rule:</strong> During the first player’s first turn of the game, that player cannot play or
					discard more than one card from their hand. Card effects can modify this rule.
				</li>
				<li>
					The active player may not play, use, or discard cards that aren't of the active house unless specified by a card ability.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h2>Step 4: Ready Cards</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The active player readies each of their exhausted cards. <!-- TODO link --></p>
		</div>

		<h2>Step 5: Draw Cards</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The active player draws cards from the top of their deck until they have six cards in their hand. After a player completes this step, their turn ends.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					If the active player has more than six cards in hand, they do not
			discard down to six.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a player needs to draw cards (during this step or at any other time) and cannot because their deck is empty, that player shuffles their discard pile to reset their deck, and then continues to draw (cards are drawn one at a time).
				</li>
				<li>
					When a player’s turn ends, if that player has enough Æmber in their pool to afford a key, the player announces “Check!” so that their opponent knows the forging of a key at the start of that player’s next turn is imminent.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
