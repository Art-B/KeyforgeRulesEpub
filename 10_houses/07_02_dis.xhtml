		<h3 />
		<p>
			There are stories told across the Crucible of terrible
			monsters that dwell in the space between worlds.
			These creatures burst forth from the ground to terrify
			innocent people, their capering imps stealing æmber
			and their powerful demons destroying any who
			would oppose them. Those unlucky or foolish enough
			to travel to their netherworld home, known as Dis, are
			never heard from again.
		</p>
		<p>
			The half-living demons, the stories continue, are creatures of the
			between-worlds and so they have no life, no pain, no joy to call their
			own. Instead, they must steal these things from the innocent people of
			the Crucible. They seek out the most extreme emotions and consume
			them for sustenance. Where there is great rage, there lurks a demon,
			stoking the fires of animosity and harvesting the emotions, the very
			soul, of the wrathful being. Greed, fear, suffering—all these emotions,
			the demons cause in mortal folk in order to harvest them and return
			them to their evil lairs.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Theorists of Logos deride such tales as superstitious folly, and
			explain that the demons are merely parasitic beings that make their
			home in the suprastructure of the Crucible that divides this layer from
			the one below it. Emotionally numb due to the lack of stimulus in this
			space, the “demons” use the psycho-reactive properties of æmber
			to capture emotional and mental imprints of other residents of the
			Crucible, returning them to Dis for later study or perhaps recreational
			experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fact that these theories are exactly the same as the “superstitious”
			stories with fancier words is one those same Theorists dismiss as hooey,
			repeating the exact same explanation, only slower.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			The demons of Dis are, despite the myths, creatures of flesh and blood,
			or at least skin (or insectile chitin) and ichor, in addition to the technological
			nightmare-horror of their many cybernetic augmentations. It
			is not clear whether all demons are of the same species beneath their
			cryptic masks, or whether demonhood is bestowed upon various creatures
			through some sinister process. Volunteers to study the question
			are, understandably, in short supply.
		</p>
		<p>
			The demons are served by imps, chaotic and often mischievous robotic
			beings, driven by an intelligence scarcely less frightening than their
			demonic masters.
		</p>
		<p>
			The less said of humans who join the faction willingly, the better.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Dis machines are part sorcery and part high technology, and the
			demons infuse æmber into every facet of their devices so that they, too,
			can capture the emotions of their victims. The furnaces of Dis burn with
			intense heat, where their black iron is smelted, and “souls” (or imprinted
			emotions) are broken down into their core elements for demonic
			consumption. These same blasted æmber shards are then incorporated
			into the imps and other self-aware machines used by the demons, and
			sent out to gather more æmber and more souls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even when not functionally required, Dis devices tend to have sharp
			edges, a scalding touch, spikes, and a host of other opportunities for
			the unwary to injure themselves.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			Archons are the only beings on the Crucible who can be said to truly
			communicate with the demons of Dis, and many of them find the
			demons endlessly fascinating. Dis’s devotion to the extremes of sensation
			and emotion may be particularly attractive to archons who struggle
			with empathizing with the mortal condition—some archons have even
			requested the demons introduce them personally to the concepts of
			pain and fear.
