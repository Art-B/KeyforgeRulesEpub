		<h3 />
		<p>
			The Architects brought together plants, animals,
			and other lifeforms from all across the universe to
			populate their Crucible. In fact, they continue to do
			so, blending together alien biomes into something,
			if not quite harmonious, at least verdantly and boisterously
			alive.
		</p>
		<p>
			The various wild creatures of the Crucible are tended to
			by mechanical faeries, quirky automatons that do their best to keep a
			semblance of balance in place. But while they struggle to maintain this
			balance, the faeries make no attempt to keep the wildlife segregated,
			and so wolves from Earth may soon find themselves hunted by Martian
			snekgarrs, Niffle apes from Regulus Prime hang from the branches of
			the slow-blooming nepenthe tree of Visgard, and Alpha Centaurian
			sugar ants are consumed by Venusian flytraps. (Not to be confused
			with the surprisingly-similar plants from Earth.) Over time, these species
			evolve to find a comfortable home on the Crucible, even blending
			and interbreeding with aliens where they find compatible biology
			(sometimes aided by faeries and the strange mutations wrought by
			wild æmber). While some of these animals may still be recognizable
			as similar to the beasts on their planets of origin, others are wholly and
			forevermore creatures of the Crucible, and found nowhere else in the
			universe.
		</p>
		<p>
			Collectively, these wild creatures are referred to as the Untamed.
			Together with the humans and other sentients who reject civilization
			and retreat to the wild, they form a large and chaotic faction of their
			own. With no central organization (indeed, in many cases with no true
			intelligence) to speak of, the only constant to the Untamed is that they
			live true to their natures, whatever those natures may be.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			Since the Untamed includes, by definition, every wild creature, plant, fungus,
			or other living thing on the Crucible, its diversity is impossible to overstate,
			but we’ll try: it’s very diverse. As for the sentient beings best described as
			“people” (of whatever species), they have more commonalities. Some were
			raised in civilized societies and turned away from them. Others have only
			ever lived in the wild. All are more comfortable under the open sky of the
			Crucible than in the cities of stone and steel, more able to converse with the
			beasts and birds than with their fellow sentients.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of these sentients, perhaps thanks to liberal consumption and use
			of æmber, have developed a near-supernatural ability to speak not only to
			animals, but to plants and fungus as well. Their abilities seem like magic, and
			many call these people “witches,” or by other names drawn from their own
			mythologies. But they are harmless. Mostly.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			The Untamed as a whole do not use technology, since most scholarly
			distinctions between sentient being and wild beast revolve around its
			use. Still, there is some blurriness at the edges, and while Niffle apes
			may be considered animals, they do fashion crude jewelry and use
			simple tools when appropriate. The faeries of the wilderness are all
			machines, as well, and there are some truly strange examples of synthetic
			life in the galaxy that confuse the line ever further.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of the sentients who might be considered Untamed have walked
			away from most technology, but even in the wild places of the Crucible
			there are machines and tech to be scavenged and repurposed. Most
			civilizations will eventually succumb to the wild, after all.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			The minds of the animals present a unique test of an archon’s vaunted
			ability to communicate with any denizen of the Crucible. Some are
			drawn to the uncomplicated thought patterns of the Untamed, considering
			them a calming influence and a source of comfort. Other archons
			are drawn to the sense of wild and natural freedom these creatures
			exhibit. For the most part, the Untamed beasts are happy to ignore
			anything that is neither predator nor prey, but some particularly social
			animals (and people) enjoy the undemanding company of an archon
			during their travels.
