		<h3 />
		<p>
			The Svarr elves that dwell in the Shadows are a motley
			collection of rogues, confidence artists, thieves, and
			sometime-assassins. Physically unimposing, the elves
			make up for it with speed, cleverness, and a light-fingered
			approach to other people’s possessions and
			technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			Loosely organized into a series of like-minded guilds, the Svarr are
			a curious mixture of selfish and selfless. They will sacrifice much for
			the good of their guild, and yet ruthlessly exploit any opportunities
			presented by outsiders, robbing, cheating, and stealing for their own
			advantage without hesitation or regret.
		</p>
		<p>
			Svarr histories hold that they once dwelled in a land of light and peace,
			but were exiled to the Shadows, where they were forced to hide and
			scavenge in order to survive. It isn’t clear whether this exile predates
			their translocation to the Crucible or if the myth (if myth it is) is directly
			based on that translocation, but whatever the case they hold the story
			as justification for any and all misdeeds. Fortunately for the Svarr, they
			are extremely talented in all arts of stealth, misdirection, and repurposing
			other people’s tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many are confused by what, precisely, the Shadows are—a nation, a
			place, a state of mind? The Svarr are pragmatic about it: anyplace they
			hide, anyplace they do their business, that’s the Shadows. The best
			thieves can find the Shadows anywhere.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			Most of the thieves in the Shadows are from the Svarr tribe of elves,
			a diminutive, dark, large-eyed people with wicked grins and sharp
			senses. Clannish and suspicious of outsiders, the Svarr dominate every
			Shadows guild. Svarr can also be found living and working alongside
			beings of all species in all sorts of places and under all sorts of creeds
			and governments. But these individuals may also be Shadows, because
			a good thief can blend in anywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			Humans and other aliens sometimes fall in with the Shadows guilds.
			After all, crime isn’t unique to the Svarr and they’ll recruit any asset that
			seems useful. Some of these recruits find themselves more at home in
			the Shadows than in their homelands, and eventually join a guild fulltime,
			where they are, after proving themselves, as welcome as any Svarr.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Most Shadows technology is stolen or scavenged from someone else
			and then repurposed for Shadows use. Some Shadows operatives have
			even managed to reprogram the faeries that steward the Crucible’s
			biospheres, using them as scouts, saboteurs, assistants, and simply as
			pets (they are cute, after all).
		</p>
		<p>
			If the Shadows have one piece of technology that is uniquely theirs, it is
			their cloaks, clever stealth emitters that surround them with an invisibility
			field. Shadows elves frequently wear the distinctive three-dot stealth
			emitters all over their outfits for complete coverage of invisibility or illusion
			technology, as required. Using their cloaks, the thieves and rogues
			can always return to the Shadows whenever they need.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			The Svarr have a simple means of assessing anything that isn’t of their
			guild: can it help, or is it a threat? Archons are clearly both, so they must
			be approached with care. But if one can be turned to an ally, then the
			dividends paid to the guild could be extreme. If nothing else, archons
			can apparently speak to anyone or anything, so they can help arrange
			deals and trades in the Shadows. Archons, who have to be introduced
			to the concepts of “personal property” and “ownership” by others at
			some point, find the Shadows interpretation of such concepts intriguing.
			The balance of “me first” and “anything for a mate” that defines
			Svarr culture is one that many archons find eminently sensible.
