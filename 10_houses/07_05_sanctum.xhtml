		<h3 />
		<p>
			Floating as if by magic above the surface of the Crucible
			are many large islands, improbable paradises
			of water, stone, and green growing things. Some
			believe that these islands are but the beginnings
			of a new layer of the Crucible, to be assembled by
			the Architects over the following millennia; others speculate
			that this new layer is already under construction and
			these islands must be leftovers from that process.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, many of these islands are governed by and collectively
			referred to as the Sanctum. A theocratic nation-state unified by their
			gnostic faith and protected by the angelic Knights of the Sanctum (as
			well as various other knightly and crusading orders), the Sanctum is
			safe, clean, and pleasant, which is a rare combination for any realm on
			the Crucible. Wherever the golden wings of their knights spread, the
			innocent and just can rest easy, knowing that they are protected by the
			Church of the Opened Eye. (The definitions of the terms “innocent” and
			“just”, of course, are determined by the Church itself.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The bulk of the Sanctum’s flesh-and-blood adherents are human
			beings, but certainly the Church of the Opened Eye does not have its
			origins on the human homeworld. It’s possible that the Sanctum and
			their faith were both created on the Crucible, perhaps in imitation of
			the archons with which early adherents must have been familiar. If the
			scholars and Grey Monks know, they are not sharing those secrets with
			the unenlightened.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although they are sometimes literally above earthly concerns, the
			Sanctum has regular communication with the world below. Missionaries,
			ambassadors, and even merchants walk through the streets of the
			Crucible’s villages and cities, or even travel to wild and inhospitable
			places to bring the Sanctum’s truth to the unenlightened. Usually,
			these travelers are welcomed, and when they are not, well, that’s what
			the Knights are for.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			The religion of the Sanctum teaches that through meditation, learning,
			and spiritual growth, a being can become enlightened and transcend
			their need for an earthly body. Many of the knights and the higher-ranking
			clergy are spiritual beings of pure energy; indeed, the mighty suits
			of powered armor worn by the knights are necessary containment
			devices for their spiritual selves, who otherwise could not affect the
			physical world at all. The gleaming wings and golden swords wielded
			by the knights to such impressive effect are the spiritual (some might
			say “psychic”) projections of the believer’s will, made possible by use
			of the sacred æmber, and further evidence of the divine and spiritual
			nature of all beings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of Sanctum’s spirits can only manifest in the hallowed halls of their
			cathedrals or through the sacred armor of the knights. The most powerful
			spirits of the Sanctum, called “angels,” are no longer bound by such
			limitations, and seem to manifest their selves and will directly as beings
			of shining golden luminosity.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are still many creatures of flesh and blood within the Sanctum’s
			ranks, however. Enlightenment is not found easily, and for many is
			more about the journey than the destination. Some even profess that
			Sanctum’s spirits were always energy beings and that Enlightenment
			and Transcendence are impossible, a scam that has been propagated
			throughout the ages to oppress the masses, but such heretics are swiftly
			silenced within the Sanctum itself.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Sanctum’s signature technology is the glorious armor of its knights,
			powerful cybernetic suits that make flesh-and-blood wearers stronger,
			healthier, and faster, and enable great feats on the part of
			knightly spirits.
		</p>
		<p>
			Much of Sanctum’s technology relies on the “spiritual energy” of its
			user, and æmber is incorporated to act as a conduit. For the knights,
			this energy is often channelled into wings and halos of golden light,
			which give the warriors superior mobility and tactical awareness on the
			battlefield. Their weapons, too, are enhanced by golden energy, creating
			blades of pure light, shields that pulse with power, and other effects
			that reflect and enhance a knight’s purpose.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aside from their knights, much of the Sanctum seems almost pastoral in
			its asceticism. The architecture is beautiful, but built with time-honored
			techniques that date from ages past. Records are maintained by hand
			and on paper, food is grown through honest toil, and in general virtue,
			simplicity, and peace are valued. At least for the laity; the cathedrals
			themselves are monuments to inner light and the glory of the Sanctum,
			of course, and for them no expense shall be spared.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			The difference between a powerful Sanctum angel and an archon
			seems subtle to the point of meaninglessness to most believers of the
			Sanctum. From the point of view of the Church, archons are everything
			they believe made manifest: a pure soul, a perfect consciousness free
			of any limitations of physical form. Sanctum knights are eager to learn
			from such beings, and the archons, for their part, are often eager to
			be looked upon, treated, and worshipped as deities. Indeed, some
			archons are even up to the task, and strive to enhance the spiritual lives
			of their followers.
