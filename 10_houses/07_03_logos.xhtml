		<h3 />
		<p>
			The self-proclaimed “foremost” intellectuals and
			scholars on the Crucible are all found within the
			Society of Logic and Reason, or simply Logos.
			Any Logotarian would happily confirm this fact if
			asked, or if not asked, or if given any opportunity
			to speak at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Logos has devoted itself to the advancement of scientific knowledge
			and understanding, putting aside as many earthly (or at least fleshly)
			concerns as it can manage through use of its advanced technology.
			Individual Logotarians often replace some or all of their bodies with
			machines over the years, allowing them to escape the distractions of
			a physical form, and continue their work long after sickness or death
			would otherwise claim them. In fact, the use of cybernetic bodies is so
			widespread that no one outside the Society can recall what the physical
			bodies of the original Logotarians looked like, or even if they came to
			the Crucible in their cybernetic forms to begin with. Logos itself remains
			silent on the matter.
		</p>
		<p>
			While some call Logos’s zealous commitment to advancing knowledge
			at any cost unethical, and describe some of their more inventive experiments
			as “deranged,” “catastrophic,” or “really very bad,” true Theorists
			scoff at such backward thinking. They understand that the secrets of the
			Crucible are far more important than the lives of any one individual or
			city, and that no progress was ever made without a few naked singularity
			pinhole events warping local spacetime.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			Logos divides itself, in very broad terms, into two groups: Theorists and
			Mechanists. Each considers the other to be their intellectual inferior,
			and each is convinced that the most important contributions to science
			and technology have been made thanks to their efforts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Theorists concern themselves with the realm of pure reason and
			possibility, where new theories are constantly developed in an effort
			to decode the secrets of the universe, both as it is and as it might be.
			Anything that can be demonstrated through math and reason is seen
			as potentially true; everything else is to be regarded with suspicion and
			attacked rigorously until a theoretical model is found. Mechanists, on
			the other hand, deal with empirical data and the world as-it-is. A theory
			is useless if it cannot be tested, and a technology is unproven until it is
			built and shown to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Logos is happy to accept brilliant members of all species into its ranks;
			after all, few of them keep their organic bodies for more than a century
			or two anyway.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Logos technology is among the most advanced on the Crucible, and it
			is incorporated into every phase of their lives—indeed, it is rare to find a
			Logotarian who doesn’t have Logos technology built into their bodies.
			Whether it’s mag-tethered floating limbs (for easy modularity) or a
			quantum dissonance modulator (for…reasons), Logos machines are
			built for every conceivable purpose and also for some that aren’t.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because Logos is continually pushing the frontier of knowledge, many
			of their technologies are experimental or prototypical; some are
			never replicated because they do not work as well as desired (or work
			entirely too well in the wrong way). Some of these “machines” may have
			originated as organic beings—there is minimal ethics oversight on the
			experiments of the Logotarians.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many Logotarian machines incorporate æmber into
			their function, either as a power source or to harness
			some of its more esoteric properties. Others are
			designed expressly to investigate and analyze
			æmber, a project which has remained
			stubbornly difficult no matter how advanced
			Logos’s science becomes.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			For Logos, archons are one of the ultimate
			unsolved puzzles of the Crucible. They
			eagerly study archons and are happy to
			work with them to learn more of their
			nature. Since archons are also generally
			curious about their own nature, many
			join in Logos’s quest for knowledge.
