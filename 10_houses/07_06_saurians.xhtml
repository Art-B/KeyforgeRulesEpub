		<h3 />
		<p>
			To say that the Saurus Rex rules over the Saurian
			people is an overstatement. She stands only as
			the first among equals in the Saurian Senate—but
			this still makes her one of the most powerful and
			important people in the Locality.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an empire that is literally millions of years old, the
			Saurian Republic is possibly the oldest coherent culture
			on the Crucible. Although it has risen and fallen many times in its long
			history, the Saurians have survived and thrived over epochs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, the city-states of the Saurian Republic live side-by-side with the
			other peoples of the Crucible, a shining example to what the Hegemonic
			political party calls “lesser beings.” (In other words, foreigners.) Some
			(among the Hegemonics) may argue that the Republic is in decline, but
			others (such as the Sequestarians) say simply that it has outgrown its
			expansionistic, warmongering days. Still a strong power, the Saurians
			have resisted Martian aggression from Nova Hellas and broken three
			separate Sanctum crusades, but their days of conquest ended with the
			defeat of the Smilodon Barbarians.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			The Tribes of the Saurian Republic, including the Longusaurs, Carnisaurs,
			Cornifaciems, Loricadons, Herbisaurs, Volatusaurs, and Marinusaurs,
			trace their lineage back to dinosaurs placed on the Crucible
			some sixty-five million years ago. It’s difficult to speak in broad terms of
			the Saurian people, but most females tend to be somewhat larger than
			the males, whereas the males tend to be somewhat more colorful than
			the females.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although there’s substantial variation both between and within the
			tribes, Saurians tend to be large and physically potent creatures by the
			standards of other intelligent beings of the Crucible. Even the giants of
			Brobnar would think twice before challenging a Longusaur to physical
			combat! But more than that, the Saurians pride themselves as the
			most advanced philosophical minds on the Crucible. Their Senatorial
			debates are legendary for their duration and the strength, passion, and
			insight of their arguments.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Saurian technology is so advanced that many lesser civilizations mistake
			it for magic. Each artifact is built to marry form and function, a beautiful
			and harmonious union of advanced technology and traditional designs.
			The spears and shields of their warriors are more potent than any crude
			raygun or projectile. Even their beasts of burden demonstrate superior
			Saurian technology, their behavior ably controlled by advanced Saurian
			harnesses and tack and their abilities enhanced by superior genetics
			and breeding programs.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			Archons are integrated into Saurian society in a way almost unheard-of
			on the Crucible. Archons are granted permission to attend meetings
			of the Saurian Senate by default, where it is hoped that they will learn
			from the great wisdom on display there. Archons of noted wisdom or
			erudition are welcome in the Saurian academies, and there have been
			a dozen or so instances of Archons serving as Governor of a city-state
			throughout the history of the Saurian Republic.
