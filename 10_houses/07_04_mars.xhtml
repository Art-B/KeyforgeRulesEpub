		<h3 />
		<p>
			Mars, as an empire, is exceptional in that it has
			remained a more-or-less unchanged political and
			cultural bloc after its relocation to the Crucible by the
			Architects two centuries ago. Perhaps due to the fact
			that the transition occurred during the final days of the
			Fall of Mars, or perhaps simply based on Mars’ relative-
			newcomer status, the Martian Empire has remained
			intact on the Crucible. It is still under the control of the Martian Elders
			and still aggressively dominating as much of the Crucible as they can
			manage in their xenophobic crusade to ensure that Mars Lives On.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now powered by æmber, rather than the cavorite that poisoned their
			home planet, Mars’s war machine has found some success, but also
			more difficult and dangerous foes than they could have expected.
			New life forms on the Crucible mean more opportunities for Martian
			biological engineers to breed a perfect monster. New elements, such
			as æmber, provide more fodder for Martian scientists and engineers.
			But Martian soldiers with their ray guns and Martian vehicles with their
			blasters are not always victorious when pitted against Brobnar warriors
			or swarms of Niffle apes. For Mars to have true victory, they must
			reclaim the skies with their flying saucers. Unfortunately, they have had
			only limited success in rebuilding the Martian fleet, and some mysterious
			force keeps their spaceships from rising above the atmosphere.
		</p>
		<p>
			Still, by maintaining large cloning facilities and dropping their soldiers
			into combat from hovering motherships, the relatively weak (in a physical
			sense) Martians have established themselves in Nova Hellas, and
			now control three entire cities. Tremble before the might of Mars!
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			Unlike many other factions on the Crucible, Mars remains committed to
			genetic and cultural purity, that Mars may never die. Even before their
			translocation to the Crucible, Mars was using genetic enhancement
			technology and extensive cloning to divide their culture into two distinct
			castes: the taller, more intelligent Elders, who rule over the smaller,
			weaker, and far more numerous Martian Soldiers.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the Soldier caste are expected to display utter loyalty to Mars and
			are discouraged (sometimes with cranial electro-correction) from developing
			unique personalities, Elders are varied in their areas of expertise
			and interest, and have considerable leeway to indulge their personal
			desires. Some develop new biological weapons (whether plagues or
			horrifying monsters), some study the lesser beings and the Crucible,
			others archive Martian culture and history. Together, the Elders collectively
			rule the Martian Empire—all for the glory of Mars!
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Martian technology was highly advanced when they were translocated
			to the Crucible and, despite needing to completely re-invent itself for
			its new context, has only become more sophisticated since. Martian
			soldiers go to war armed with powerful and mysterious weapons and
			piloting highly advanced, lethal walkers and ships, while genetically-
			modified monstrosities are turned loose as a vanguard, hopefully
			against the enemies of Mars. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, most Martian
			technologies are either purpose-built for war, or soon turned to that
			purpose.)
		</p>
		<p>
			While Mars once relied on cavorite to power its rayguns and levitate
			its flying saucers, it has found a suitable substitute in the æmber found
			only on the Crucible. The psycho-reactive æmber seems to have
			unlocked the psychic potential of the Martian race, and new experiments
			in mind control, telepathy, and other psionic technologies promise
			great things for the Martian future.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			To the Elders of Mars, archons are both potential threat and ally. Their
			wisdom and power is undeniable, but they carry with them an undeniable
			potential to corrupt Martian purity with their foreign ideas and
			companions. Still, the threat is acceptable when the payoff is so high,
			and so the Elders tolerate fraternization with the archons (not that they
			have much of a choice). For their part, archons seldom get a chance
			to explore a society that has remained so wholly itself. And of course
			the gleeful belligerence of the Martian war machine is attractive in its
			own way.
