		<h3 />
		<p>
			On their continuing mission of exploration, the crew of
			the SAV Quantum found themselves falling through an
			anomalous energy field and crash-landing on the
			Crucible. As they struggle to survive in their new
			world, the scientists, explorers, and small military
			contingent of the Grand Star Alliance continue
			their mission, boldly going where no man, woman,
			neuter, or other-gendered-being have gone before!
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, everywhere they look they find men, women, neuters, and
			other-gendered-beings, but never let it be said that the Alliance let the
			facts get in the way of their sense of adventure. And the fact remains:
			the Star Alliance has spent decades exploring the galaxy, bringing
			dozens of star systems into the peaceful and democratic Alliance as
			they extend their scientific knowledge everywhere…and yet, they had
			never even heard a hint of the Crucible’s existence. If they can ever
			get the Quantum spaceworthy again and get back in touch with Fleet
			Command, they will be bringing home a discovery beyond anything in
			the databooks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since crash-landing on the Crucible, the Alliance crew have built up a
			small city in the rocky savannah of the Valley of Time. Officially designated
			as “Camp One,” pretty much everyone calls it by its true name:
			Quantum City.
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			The Star Alliance is a polyglot, multi-species community spanning dozens
			of star systems. It counts at least twenty member species with full voting
			rights, not to mention the increasingly-intelligent robots and dozens of other
			species who have friendly relations with the Alliance and live among them
			without being full members.
		</p>
		<p>
			The crew of the Quantum is mainly humans (from Earth and elsewhere),
			aided by a diverse array of robots and led by the brave Captain Val Jericho.
			But there are a number of aliens on Jericho’s crew, many serving as
			high-ranking officers. For example, Science Officer Qincan is a proximan
			from Alpha Centauri. Proximans are renowned for their quick and agile
			brains and nimble fingers, although the light gravity and gentle climate of
			their homeworld has left them rather less hardy than other species. Security
			officer Lieutenant Khrkhar, however, is from a much more durable species,
			the handuhan. Stocky, powerful, and protected by armored plates, the
			handuhan are a proud species of warriors who take great joy in competition
			and overcoming extreme odds. The third major alien species represented
			on the Quantum are the insectile krxix, who despite their unsettling appearance
			have an overwhelmingly friendly, helpful, and self-sacrificing attitude
			toward their crewmates. The communal krxix hives on their homeworld are
			paragons of cooperation and togetherness, supporting populations that are
			enormous by the standards of the rest of the Alliance due to their efficiency
			and humble needs.
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			The Star Alliance has advanced technology, including sophisticated computers,
			environment suits, vehicles, robots, jet packs, ray guns, and the omni-present
			wrist modules that links each crew member back to the Quantum’s central computer.
			However, despite their advanced technology, the engineers have been unable to
			get the Quantum functional again, and have been forced to strip out many of
			her subsystems to provide needed support for the growing Star Alliance camp on
			the Crucible. It’s possible that this strange new substance, æmber, is interfering
			with the Quantum’s systems—further study is required.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to their wrist-coms, Quantum crew make use of modular attachments
			that they customize to the task at hand. They’re supported in their mission by
			a variety of dedicated robots, including many that are vehicles such as the
			crew-favorite R0-V3R all-terrain buggy, also called an “Explo-Rover,” perfect
			for exploring strange planets.
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			As possibly the newest arrivals on the Crucible, the crew of the
			Quantum are a curiosity for the archons. Watching the Alliance explorers
			discover the Crucible for the first time, the archons get to see it all
			with fresh eyes. There’s also the mystery of the Quantum’s appearance
			to consider—were they transported accidentally, along with the planet
			beneath them? Did they arrive “the hard way,” flying into the Crucible
			from outside? In either case, they may be the first such arrivals in the
			Crucible’s history!
		</p>
		<p>
			For their part, Captain Jericho and her crew are happy to enlist “native
			guides” as they set out to unlock the mysteries of the universe.
