		<h3 />
		<p>
			Whether they’re descending from snowy mountaintops
			to raid, riding grumbling motorsteeds across the blasted
			wastes, or laughing in the rain on the stormy seas,
			the warclans of the Brobnar are always a fearsome
			sight. A varied people, each Brobnar warclan is ruled
			by the strongest—whether that strength is shown on the
			field of battle, in the Champion’s Ring, or demonstrated by
			sheer force of personality and brilliance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the oral traditions of the giants describe a journey from the
			mythical land of Vanhalla, most scholars believe that the Brobnar culture
			as it exists today was created on the Crucible, perhaps through a
			merger of the early giants and the first goblin tribes they encountered.
			Through the centuries, the Brobnar have evolved their own unique
			identity, independent of any of the member tribes they have absorbed.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, the Brobnar value strength above all. In Brobnar society, each is
			entitled only to what their strength allows them to take, and an opponent
			or rival without the strength to defend their property has no claim
			to it. Second, Brobnar are very conscious of their image and the projection
			of strength—to be seen as weak is the same as being weak. Third,
			the Brobnar love loud music, strong alcohol, and shiny things.
		</p>
		<p>
			To the rest of the Crucible, the Brobnar are dangerous enemies and
			valuable allies. Some warclans extract tribute from their neighbors, and
			others hire themselves off as mercenaries. Many Brobnar spend time
			living with other peoples, showing off Brobnar strength and learning
			(sometimes painfully) about life on the Crucible. Every now and again,
			one learns the most valuable lesson of all: that as strong as they are
			apart, every giant, goblin, or other creature is stronger working together…
			and when this happens, the whole Crucible trembles!
		</p>

		<h3>Society</h3>
		<p>
			Most Brobnar are giants, powerful humanoid creatures nearly 3 meters
			tall with mottled skin in a variety of shades. They tend to wear their hair
			in brightly-colored crests, with long beards for those who care to grow
			them, and adorn themselves with tattoos and sigils of their clan. The
			Gargantes clan, for example, decorates their bodies with blue tattoos
			to celebrate their escape from the Ice-Maze of the Robo-Sorcerer. (The
			Gargantes treasure horde also features the Skull of the Sorcerer, which
			looks almost exactly like a tin can.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Long ago, a large population of small, clever goblins joined the Brobnar
			people. They are mostly relegated to second-class, servant status
			due to their small size and perceived weakness, but goblins are a tough
			gritty breed, and a handful of them have risen as respected leaders and
			shamans even among the giants.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Brobnar, on the whole, will accept anyone into their clans, so long
			as that person is strong-willed and eager to fight!
		</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Although they seem brutish and simple to some more civilized peoples,
			Brobnar are great proponents of any technology that is loud, destructive,
			or preferably both. A violent people prone to injury and misadventure,
			they make widespread use of cybernetic replacements and
			augmentation. They favor weapons that allow them to engage their
			enemies directly and revel in their great strength, but even their axes,
			hammers, and smashing gauntlets are often enhanced with engines,
			rockets, and other innovations that make them louder and more powerful.
			(Also, in many cases, more dangerous to the user, but Brobnar
			don’t usually mind that.) Since they value strength, they use their
			æmber as a source of power for certain machines, or even adorn
			their bodies with it to make themselves stronger.
		</p>
		<p>
			Brobnar goods are individually hand-made by artisans, with minimal
			existing industrial infrastructure. As such, they are made to last
			and an artisan whose products are durable, beautiful, and noisy
			can be as esteemed as any warrior. Brobnar also have a keen eye
			(and ear) for beauty&hellip;by Brobnar standards. Others may find
			their art and music to be, mainly, “loud.”
		</p>

		<h3>Archons</h3>
		<p>
			Brobnar are an intensely physical people and find the
			more ethereal nature of the archons puzzling. If an
			archon wants the respect of the Brobnar, they must
			manifest physically and then display strength of either
			will or body, neither of which is generally difficult for
			archons. Once they have proven themselves, archons
			find that the Brobnar are loyal and excellent companions,
			jovial and direct. Many archons with Brobnar allies find
			themselves wearing physical bodies more and more often,
			enjoying the simple and universal pleasures of such a form.
