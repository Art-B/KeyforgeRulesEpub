    <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
    <p>
        This section introduces a number of foundational concepts to keep in mind while playing the game
    </p>

    <h2>THE GOLDEN RULE</h2>
    <p>
        If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of the rules, the text of the card takes precedence.
    </p>


    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        During the game, players use their cards to collect Æmber. Players use Æmber to forge keys. The game ends immediately when a player forges their third key, and that player wins the game.
    </p>


    <h2>Ready and Exhausted</h2>
    <p>
        Cards that are in play exist in one of two states:
        <img src="img/ready-exhausted.jpg" alt=""/>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Ready</dt>
        <dd>Ready cards are oriented upright so that their text may be read from left to right. A ready card can be used during a player’s turn, causing it to exhaust.</dd>

        <dt>Exhausted</dt>
        <dd>Exhausted cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side. An exhausted card is not able to be used until it is readied by a game step or card ability.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p><strong>All creatures and artifacts enter play exhausted.</strong></p>



    <h2>Running out of Tokens or Status Cards</h2>
    <p>
        There is no limit to the number of damage tokens, Æmber tokens, or status cards that can be in the game area at a given time. If there is a shortage of the provided tokens or status cards, other tokens, counters, or coins may be used to track the game state.
