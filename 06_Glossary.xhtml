		<h1>Glossary</h1>
		<p>
			This Glossary includes a number of concepts and terms players may encounter while playing the game, in alphabetical order. Instead of reading this section from beginning to end, players are encouraged to only look up new concepts as they are encountered during play.
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>ability, card ability</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					An ability is the special game text a card contributes to the game.
					Unless an ability explicitly references an out-of-play area (such as a hand,
					deck, archives, or discard pile), that ability can only interact with cards
					that are in play. Abilities that interact with a card after it is destroyed can
					interact with that card while it is in the discard pile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abilities on a creature, artifact, or upgrade are only active (and can
					only be triggered) while that card is in play, unless the ability explicitly
					references being used from an out-of-play area. Once an ability on a card
					has been triggered, that ability will finish resolving even if the card leaves
					play.
				</p>
				<p>
					If resolving part of the instructions of a card ability causes other card
					effects to trigger, resolve those other card effects before continuing to
					resolve the instructions of the first card.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>action ability</dt>
			<dd>
				To use an <span class="keyword">Action</span>> ability during their turn, the active player must exhaust the card. The ability then resolves.
			</dd>

			<dt>active house</dt>
			<dd>
				The active house is the house that the active player has chosen for the current turn.
			</dd>

			<dt>active player</dt>
			<dd>
				The active player is the player taking the current turn. The active player makes all necessary decisions for all card abilities or timing conflicts that need to resolve during their turn.
			</dd>

			<dt>adjacent</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a creature card refers to a game element as being “adjacent” to
					that creature or being played “adjacent” to that creature, it is referring to
					a card being in or being played into the position to the immediate right
					or immediate left of that creature.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a class="term" href="#neighbor">Neighboring</a>
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>æmber</dt>
			<dd>
				<img src="img/aember_token.jpg" alt="an æmber token"/>
				<p>
					Æmber is tracked by Æmber tokens, and is used to forge keys.
				</p>
				<p>
					Only Æmber in your own Æmber pool is considered “yours” for the purpose of card effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Capture, Keys, Reap, Steal.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>æmber bonus icon <img src="img/aember_bonus.jpg" alt="æmber bonus symbol" /></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					See "Bonus Icons"
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>alpha</dt>
			<dd>
				When a card has the Alpha keyword, it can only be played if you haven’t
				played, used, or discarded any other cards during the current step of
				your turn.
			</dd>

			<dt>anomaly</dt>
			<dd>
				<img src="img/anomaly.png" alt="anomaly symbol"/>
				<p>
					This symbol indicates that a card is an anomaly card. An anomaly card is an extremely rare card that
					is a preview of possible future sets of KeyForge. An anomaly card may appear in any house, and is
					treated as belonging to that house for all game purposes.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>archives</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					A player’s archives is a facedown game area in front of that player’s
					identity card. Card abilities are the only means by which a player is
					permitted to add cards to their archives. During step 2 of a player’s turn,
					after they select an active house, the active player is permitted to pick up
					all cards in their archives and add those cards to their hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cards in a player’s archives are considered out of play.
				</p>
				<p>
					A player may look at their archives at any time. A player is not permitted
					to look at an opponent’s archives.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the ability instructing a player to archive a card does not specify where
					the card is archived from, the archived card comes from that player’s hand.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>armor</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Some creatures have an armor value to the right of the card title. Armor
					prevents an amount of damage equal to the armor value that the creature
					would take each turn. Armor prevents damage before it is actually dealt.
					For example, if a creature has two armor and is dealt one damage, that
					damage is instead prevented by the armor, leaving the creature with
					one armor that can prevent damage left for the rest of the turn. If the
					creature is later dealt three more damage during that turn, one damage is
					prevented and the other two damage are dealt to that creature.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a creature gains armor, the gains are additive and accumulate on top of
					the creature’s printed armor value.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a creature gains armor during a turn, the gained armor does not
					prevent damage already dealt that turn. If a creature loses armor during
					a turn, it is not retroactively dealt damage that was already prevented by
					the armor.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a creature loses any amount of armor, it loses armor that has been
					used to prevent damage this turn before it loses armor that has not been
					used to prevent damage this turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a creature has a “~” symbol in its armor field, the creature has no
					armor. Such creatures may gain armor through card effects.
				</p>
			</dd>


			<dt><q>as if it were yours</q>/<q>as if you controlled it</q></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If a card effect instructs you to use a card “as if it were yours” or “as if
					you controlled it,” it causes you to use the card even if you don’t control
					it. You never gain control of the card during this process, but you resolve
					the effect as if you controlled the card.
				</p>
				<p>
					When using a card “as if it were yours/as if you controlled it” that
					instructs you to sacrifice the card as part of the effect, the card is still
					sacrificed as if you controlled it.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>assault <var>(X)</var></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a creature with the assault <var>(X)</var> keyword attacks, it deals damage
					equal to its assault value (i.e., “<var>X</var>”) to the creature it is fighting before the
					fight resolves. (The active player chooses whether this occurs before or
					after other “Before Fight” effects and keywords.) If this damage destroys
					the other creature, the rest of the fight does not occur.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a creature with the assault (X) keyword gains another instance of the
					assault (X) keyword, the two X values are added together.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>ATTACK, ATTACKER, ATTACKING</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					“Fight”
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>battleline</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The battleline is the ordered line of creatures a player controls in play.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Creatures”
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>before</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If the word “before” is used in an ability (for example, “Before Reap:” or
					“Before Fight:”), that ability resolves before resolving the game effect of
					the reap or fight (but after the card exhausts, if exhausting is required to
					use the card).
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>bonus icons</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Many cards have one or more bonus icons in the upper-left corner, below
					the house icon. After a card with a bonus icon is played, the first thing
					the active player does is resolve each bonus icon on that card. These
					icons are resolved after the card enters play (if it is an artifact, creature,
					or upgrade), but before resolving any “Play:” abilities
				</p>
				<p>
					Bonus icons must be resolved in the order printed on the card, from top
					to bottom. Resolving each bonus icon is mandatory.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are four types of bonus icons:
				</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Æmber <img src="img/aember_bonus_symbol.png" alt="æmber bonus symbol"/></dt>
						<dd>
							Gain 1 Æmber.
						</dd>

						<dt>Capture <img src="img/capture_bonus_symbol.png" alt="capture bonus symbol"/></dt>
						<dd>
							A friendly creature captures 1 Æmber from the opponent.
							This Æmber may be captured by any friendly creature, including the
							creature with the capture icon. If a card has multiple capture icons, the
							captured Æmber may be distributed among multiple creatures.
						</dd>

						<dt>Damage <img src="img/damage_bonus_symbol.png" alt="damage bonus symbol"/></dt>
						<dd>
							Deal 1 damage to a creature in play. This damage may
							be dealt to the creature with the damage icon. Note that if there are
							no enemy creatures in play, this damage must be dealt to a friendly
							creature. If a card has multiple damage icons, each damage icon is
							resolved separately, one at a time, and the damage may be distributed
							among multiple creatures. Damage dealt by a bonus icon is not
							considered to be dealt by the card on which the icon appears.
						</dd>

						<dt>Draw <img src="img/draw_bonus_symbol.png" alt="draw bonus symbol"/></dt>
						<dd>
							Draw 1 card.
						</dd>
					</dl>
			</dd>

			<dt>cannot vs must/may, cannot vs permissive</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If two card effects are simultaneously instructing a player that they
					“cannot” do something and that they “must” or “may” do the same
					thing, the “cannot” effect takes precedence.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Anna controls a Pitlord (CoTA 093) which reads <q class="card_text">While
					Pitlord is in play you must choose Dis as your active house.</q> On their
					next turn Anna’s opponent plays Restringuntus (CoTA 094) which reads
					<q class="card_text">Play: Choose a house. Your opponent cannot choose that house as
					their active house until Restringuntus leaves play.</q> and chooses Dis
					for its ability. On Anna’s next turn, she both must and cannot choose
					Dis, but because cannot takes precedence over must, she only cannot
					choose Dis and must choose one of her other houses instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					If two card effects are simultaneously instructing a player that they
					cannot do something and that they may do something, the “cannot”
					effect takes precedence.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>capture</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Captured Æmber is taken from an opponent’s Æmber pool and placed
					on a creature controlled by the capturing player. Players may not spend
					captured Æmber.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is placed in
					the opponent’s Æmber pool.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless otherwise specified, Æmber is placed on the creature that
					captured it.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>capture bonus icon <img src="img/capture_bonus_symbol.png" alt="capture bonus symbol"/></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					"Bonus Icons"
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>center of the battleline</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					A creature is in the center of the battleline when there are an equal
					number of creatures to both that creature’s left and right side.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is only a center of a battleline if there is an odd number of
					creatures in that battleline. When there is an even number of creatures
					in a battleline, there is no center. If there is only one creature in the
					battleline that creature is in the center.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>chain, chains</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Some card abilities cause a player to gain one or more chains. If a player
					gains chains, that player increases their chain tracker by the number of
					chains gained.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a player has at least one chain when refilling their hand and would
					draw cards based on the number of remaining cards in their hand, they
					draw fewer cards according to the chart below. Then, they shed one
					chain by reducing the number on their chain tracker by one.
				</p>
				<table id="chains">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Chains</th> <th>Effect</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td> 1–6</td>  <td>draw 1 fewer card.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td> 7–12</td> <td>draw 2 fewer cards.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>13–18</td> <td>draw 3 fewer cards.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>19–24</td> <td>draw 4 fewer cards.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p>
					While drawing an initial hand of cards during setup, if a deck has chains
					assigned to it, the chains also apply to the initial hand of cards drawn as
					if you were refilling a hand during step 5. A chain is shed for this initial
					draw as per the standard rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					”Chains”
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>control</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					A player owns the cards that begin the game in their deck. When a card
					is played, it enters play under the control of the active player.
				</p>
				<p>
					A player can take control of an opponent’s card. When this happens,
					that card is placed in the new controller’s play area. If it is a creature, it is
					placed on a flank of the new controller’s battleline. If multiple effects that
					take control of a card are used on the same card, the most recent effect
					takes precedence.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a player takes control of a card that belongs to a house not in the new
					controller’s deck, they can make that house the active house during step
					2 of their turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a card that has changed control leaves play for any reason, it moves to
					its owner’s appropriate out-of-play zone.
				</p>
				<p>
					If an ability refers to cards that a player “has” in play, it is referring to
					cards that player controls.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>cost, at current cost</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The base cost to forge a key is six Æmber. This cost may be modified by
					card abilities. The modified cost is referred to as the current cost.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>damage</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Damage a creature has taken is tracked by placing damage tokens on
					the creature. If a creature has an amount of damage on it equal to or
					greater than its power, the creature is destroyed. Damage on a creature
					does not reduce its power. If multiple creatures are damaged by a single
					effect, that damage is dealt simultaneously.
				</p>
				<p>
					See more details on damage and combat.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>damage bonus icon <img src="img/damage_bonus_symbol.png" alt="damage bonus symbol"/></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					"Bonus Icons"
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>deploy</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					A creature with the deploy keyword does not need to be played on
					the flank of its controller’s battleline. Instead, when it is played it can
					be placed anywhere in its controller’s battleline, including between two
					other creatures.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>destroyed</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a card is destroyed by a card effect or when a creature has
					damage on it equal to or greater than its power, that card is tagged for
					destruction. After it is tagged, then that card’s “Destroyed:” abilities
					trigger, and finally the tagged card is placed into its owner’s discard pile.
					If multiple cards are simultaneously tagged for destruction, the active
					player chooses the order in which to resolve the “Destroyed:” abilities
					of any of those cards. All the tagged cards are put into their owners’
					discard piles simultaneously, and the active player chooses the order in
					which those cards are arranged in their owner’s discard piles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once a creature has been tagged for destruction, the only thing that
					can remove this tag is a replacement effect that uses the word
					“instead” and replaces the destruction of that creature. An effect that
					heals a tagged creature does not remove the destroyed tag. An effect
					may move a tagged creature to a different out-of-play area (such as
					the hand or archives), but that creature is still considered to have been
					“destroyed” for the purposes of card effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> ability causes more cards to be destroyed, they are
					also tagged for destruction, and their <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> effects will also
					trigger before cards are placed in the discard pile. None of the cards that
					have been tagged for destruction are put into their owners’ discard piles
					until all <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> effects have finished resolving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Players cannot choose to sacrifice or destroy a creature that is already
					tagged for destruction. A card that is already tagged for destruction
					cannot be tagged for destruction again, and any effect that attempts
					to destroy or sacrifice that card fails. That card still only triggers its
					<span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> abilities once.
				</p>
				<p>
					A card only triggers <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> abilities that it had at the time it was
					tagged for destruction. If a card gains a <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> ability after it is
					already tagged, that ability does not trigger.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cards that are sacrificed also count as being destroyed. They are tagged
					for destruction following the same process outlined above.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Dan has Archimedes in the middle of 4 other creatures and
					his opponent plays Gateway to Dis, destroying all creatures. First, all of
					Dan’s creatures are tagged for destruction. Then Archimedes’ neighbors
					<span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> effects trigger, archiving them. The battleline immediately
					collapses, but Archimedes’ new neighbors have already been tagged
					for destruction and cannot gain a new <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> ability, so they are
					placed in the discard pile along with Archimedes.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Emily has a Jehu the Bureaucrat, Duma the Martyr with 2
					damage, and Commander Remiel with 1 damage in play. Her opponent
					plays a Poison Wave, dealing 2 damage to each creature. This damage
					causes Duma the Martyr and Commander Remiel to be tagged for
					destruction. Duma the Martyr’s <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> effect triggers, healing Jehu
					the Bureaucrat and Commander Remiel. Since Commander Remiel was
					already tagged for destruction, it still goes to the discard pile with Duma
					the Martyr, but Jehu the Bureaucrat survives unscathed.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Marcus has a Groggins with a Phoenix Heart in play. His
					opponent, Janelle, has a Dust Imp with a Soulkeeper, a Drumble, and
					a Shaffles in play. Marcus attacks Dust Imp with Groggins, causing Dust
					Imp to be tagged for destruction. Dust Imp’s <span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> ability and the
					<span class="keyword">Destroyed</span> ability that Soulkeeper grants it both trigger simultaneously.
					Marcus chooses to let his opponent gain the 2 Æmber first, then trigger
					the Soulkeeper, which will destroy Marcus’s most powerful creature—
					Groggins. When Groggins is tagged for destruction, the Phoenix Heart
					attached to it triggers, returning Groggins to Marcus’s hand and dealing
					3 damage to each other creature. This damage then tags Drumble and
					Shaffles for destruction. Finally, all the destroyed creatures still in play
					(Dust Imp, Drumble, and Shaffles) are placed in their owner’s discard pile
					in the order of the active player (Marcus’s) choice.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>discard pile</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a card is destroyed or discarded, it is placed on top of its owner’s
					discard pile. The cards in each player’s discard pile are open information,
					and may be referenced at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The order of cards in a player’s discard pile is maintained during play,
					unless a card ability causes this order to change.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a player runs out of cards in their deck and are required to draw,
					they shuffle their discard pile to create a new deck.
				</p>

				<p>
					"Bonus Icons"
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>elusive</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The first time a creature with the elusive keyword is attacked each turn, it
					is dealt no damage and deals no damage to the attacker in the fight.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elusive only stops damage that would be dealt by each creature’s power;
					damage dealt by keywords or other abilities still applies.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>end of turn</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					End of turn effects are resolved when a player’s turn is over—after step 5, the “Draw Cards” step.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>enemy</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If a card ability refers to an “enemy” game element, it refers to an element currently controlled by the opponent.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>enhance</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Each card with the Enhance keyword has added the indicated bonus icons to random cards in your deck.
					(This has already happened during the deck generation process.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The enhance keyword has no effect during gameplay.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Mutant Cutpurse has “Enhance &#10039;&#10039;&#10039;”. As a result,
					three &#10039; bonus icons have been randomly added to cards in your
					deck. The Mutant Cutpurse itself gets no special ability from Enhance
					during gameplay.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bonus icons that have been added by Enhance can be identified by the
					graphical element shown here: <img src="img/enhanced.jpg" alt="enhanced bonus icon" />
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>enrage</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a creature becomes enraged, place an enrage status counter on
					it. When a creature with an enrage counter on it is used, it must be used
					to fight, if able. After a creature with an enrage counter on it is used to
					fight, remove all enrage counters from it.
				</p>
				<p>
					While a creature has an enrage counter on it, it cannot be enraged again.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>exalt</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When an effect instructs you to “exalt” a creature, take 1 Æmber from
					the common supply and place it on that creature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: When a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is
					placed in the opponent’s Æmber pool.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>fight</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a player uses a creature to fight, the player exhausts the creature
					and chooses an opponent’s creature. Both creatures deal an amount of
					damage equal to their power value to the opposing creature in the fight,
					and both are “fighting” for the purposes of card effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					A creature used to fight is said to be “attacking” and can be referred to
					as “the attacker” during that fight.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the attacker is not destroyed, all <span class="keyword">Fight</span> abilities on the attacking
					creature then resolve. If either creature in a fight has a constant ability
					referencing the end of the fight (example: “after an enemy creature is
					destroyed fighting this creature…”), the creature must survive the fight to
					resolve the ability. Only the attacker can trigger <span class="keyword">Fight</span> abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					If either the attacking or defending creature is destroyed while resolving Assault, Hazardous, or
					<span class="keyword">Before Fight</span> abilities, then the fight (dealing damage based on power)
					is skipped. The creatures are not considered to have been in a fight for the purpose of card effects
					that reference “fighting” or “in a fight”, and the attacking creature’s
					<span class="keyword">Fight</span> abilities will not trigger. Card effects that reference “after a
					creature fights” or “after a creature is used” will still trigger, as the creature was used to fight
					(even though the fight did not resolve).
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>“fight with”</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If an ability instructs a player to “fight with” or “ready and fight with”
					a creature, the ability is granting the player permission to use the
					designated creature to fight. The fight is resolved following the standard
					rules for fighting, against a creature controlled by the opponent.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>flank</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The creatures on the far right and far left of a player’s battleline are on
					the flanks of the line. A creature in this position is referred to as a flank
					creature. Any time a creature enters play or changes control, the active
					player chooses which flank of its controller’s battleine it is placed on.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a battleline only has one creature in it, that creature is on both the left
					and right flank and is considered a flank creature.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>"for each"</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Some abilities include an effect that uses the term “for each” to
					determine the magnitude of the effect. Unless otherwise specified, a
					player may choose to affect a different card with each instance of such
					an effect.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Shard of Pain reads “Play: Deal 1 damage to an enemy
					creature for each friendly Shard.” That damage may be distributed
					among multiple creatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some abilities specify that a player must “choose a creature,” then do an
					effect to that creature using the term “for each.” Such abilities only affect
					a single creature.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Red Planet Ray Gun reads “This creature gains, “Reap: Choose
					a creature. Deal 1 damage to that creature for each Mars creature in
					play.”” That damage must be dealt only to the chosen creature—it
					cannot be distributed among multiple creatures.
				</p>

				<p>
					See detail on forging keys
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>friendly</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If a card ability refers to a “friendly” game element, it refers to an
					element currently under the control of the same player.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>gigantic</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Gigantic creatures are spread out over 2 cards, with one card containing
					the creature’s text box and the other its art, as shown:
					<img src="img/gigantic_card_example.jpg" alt="example of a gigantic card: Deusillus (MM 244)"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to play a gigantic creature, a player must have both halves of
					the creature in hand, and play those cards together as a single creature.
					The top half of a gigantic creature has the text “1 of 2” next to its title,
					while its corresponding bottom half shares the same title and has the
					text “2 of 2” next to its rarity icon.
				</p>
				<p>
					A gigantic creature counts as 2 cards while out of play, but as a single
					creature card while in play. Playing a gigantic creature only counts
					as playing 1 card, and therefore it is allowed on the first turn. After
					a gigantic creature leaves play, the 2 halves are treated as separate
					cards again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both halves of a gigantic creature have the same title, house, and card
					type. Otherwise, each half has the attributes printed on it: the top
					half has bonus icons, while the bottom half has power, armor, and the
					text box.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a card instructing you to play or put into play a creature chooses one
					half of a gigantic creature, that effect will fail. If a card instructs you to
					play or put into play both halves of a gigantic creature, the gigantic
					creature will be played or put into play.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Bella plays Wild Wormhole, allowing her to play the top card of
					her deck. She looks at the top card and sees that it is the top half of Ultra
					Gravitron. She cannot play that card from the top of her deck (even if she

					or lower power than every creature that does not belong to that
					group. If there are not enough creatures with the lowest power
					to fulfill the group, then a creature with the next lowest power is
					eligible to be considered a part of the group. This continues until
					the group has been filled or there are no creatures remaining. If at
					any point multiple creatures are tied at the same power that could

				</p>
				<p>
					When a card moves from an in–play zone to an out-of-play zone in which
					the identities of cards are hidden from the opponent (such as a player’s
					hand, deck, or archives), any pending effects that are currently or about
					to interact with that card no longer do so, unless a card effect explicitly
					states that it interacts with that zone.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is placed in the
					opponent’s Æmber pool. If a non-creature card with Æmber on it leaves
					play, the Æmber is returned to the general token pool.

				<p>
					When a card leaves play it is always put into its owner’s appropriate

					If cards leave play while resolving an ability, later instructions in the same

					Example: Code Monkey (WC 147) has the text: "Play: Archive each
					neighboring creature. If those creatures share a house, gain 2." If
					one of the archived cards was affected by an effect that changed which

				<h4>Groups of “Most Powerful”</h4>
				<p>
					If a card effect refers to a group of “the X most powerful” creatures,

					group. If there are not enough creatures with the highest power
					to fulfill the group, then a creature with the next highest power is

					any point multiple creatures are tied at the same power that could
					qualify them for the group, but there is not enough space in the
					group for each tied creature, the active player chooses which of the

				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Tom plays the action card “Three Fates (COTA 071) which

					an 8 power creature, a 7 power creature, and two 5 power creatures.
					Tom must select 3 creatures to fill the group and must choose the
					8 power creature as the first creature for the group. There are no
					other creatures in play that are tied for most powerful. In order to fill
					the group the next most powerful creature is selected, the 7 power
					creature. After this creature is selected, again there is no creature
					in play that is tied at 7 power, so a creature from the next highest
					power must be selected. Tom thus must choose one of the 5 power
					creatures to complete the group.

					would occur, it does not occur and the replacement effect happens in its
					place.

					If a replacement effect causes something that is tagged for destruction
					to not be destroyed, this replacement effect does not resolve until
					the card would be put into the discard pile. When the card would be
					put into the discard pile, instead of putting the card into the discard
					pile, remove the destroyed tag and complete the instructions of the
					destruction replacement effect.
				</p>

				<p class="example">
					Aaron plays Dimension Door, and then reaps with a creature.
					Normally Aaron would gain 1 Æmber from reaping with the creature.
					However, the Dimension Door has set up a replacement effect that

					so Aaron steals 1 instead.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Katherine has a Commander Remiel with an Armageddon
					Cloak attached to it, and her opponent plays Gateway to Dis, destroying
					each creature in play. The destroyed effect given to Remiel by the
					Armageddon Cloak is a replacement effect that is replacing the
					destruction of the creature. This destruction is being replaced with
					healing the creature fully and destroying the Armageddon Cloak instead.
					This causes the destroyed tag to be removed from Commander Remiel
					and be given to the Armageddon Cloak.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Jamie plays Ronnie Wristclocks while her opponent has 7
					Æmber. Normally, Ronnie Wristclocks’s play effect steals 1 Æmber from

			<dt>"this way"</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If an ability refers to an effect that occurred “this way,” it is referring to
					an effect that was produced by the same resolution of that same ability.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>tide</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The tide is a mechanic from a potential future expansion. The tide is not
					in play at the start of the game, Future card abilities may cause the tide
					to change, but currently there are no such abilities in the game.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>turn</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					A turn consists of one player performing the five steps detailed in the
					game’s turn sequence, which are:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Forge a key.</li>
					<li>Choose a house.</li>
					<li>Play, discard, and use cards of the chosen house.</li>
					<li>Ready cards.</li>
					<li>Draw cards.</li>
				</ol>
			</dd>

			<dt>traits</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Traits are descriptive attributes (such as “Knight” or “Specter”) that may
					be referenced by other cards. Traits are listed at the top center of a card’s
					text box.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traits have no inherent game effect, but may be referenced by
					card abilities.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>unforge</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					If a previously forged key is “unforged,” flip the key token to its unforged
					side. The key no longer counts toward its controller’s victory condition
					and must be forged again to win the game.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>use</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					See “Using Cards”
				</p>
			</dd>


			<dt>ward</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					When a creature becomes warded, place a ward status counter on it. If
					a creature with a ward counter on it would be damaged, destroyed, or
					leave play, instead discard each ward counter on it. (Note: This prevents
					the creature from being tagged for destruction.)
				</p>
				<p>
					While a creature has a ward counter on it, it cannot be warded again.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a ward counter is placed on a creature after it has already been tagged
					for destruction, the ward counter will not prevent the creature from
					leaving play. However, it will prevent the creature from leaving play in
					other ways, such as being returned to hand.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><var>X</var></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Sometimes X is used to specify a value that is defined by a card ability.
					Unless defined by a card ability, the value of X is equal to 0.
				</p>
				<p class="example">
					Picaroon has a power of X and the ability "X is the combined
					power of Picaroon's neighbors." If your opponent plays Shadow of Dis,
					Picaroon will no longer have that ability, so Picaroon's power will be 0.
